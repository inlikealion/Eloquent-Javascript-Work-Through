I'll be working through Eloquent Javascript (http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html) to develop a solid foundation in understanding javascript. It is an endeavor to leave behind dependency on javascript libraries (namely jQuery), clear out 'cargo cult' programming, and to bring my javascript abilities in line with my markup/styling chops.

Learning by doing, this repo will be used to house my work as I go along with the chapters. I'll invite collaborators as mentors along my journey to instruct me and critique my efforts.

I am looking forward to sharpening my skills and expanding my horizons as a front-end professional, and I welcome you, whoever you may be, to observe and participate as you wish*.
